# quick-sell-app
This is a very basic MVP of what a quick sell app would look like. The app has 3 screens:

1. The Home Screen where you can select the language you wish to use and a button to navigate to the next screen.
2. The Quick Sell Screen. Here you can see a list of products, with their prices, and add them to the shopping cart. After adding all your products you can proceed to the Payment Screen by pressing the "Pay" button.
3. The Payment Screen. Here you can pay either by cash or card which would show an alert of the payment or you can cancel the transaction.

The app also contains a toolbar with a back button on the left side. And swiping from left to right on any screen will bring up the Navigation Drawer where you can access the contact pop-up in order to get help.
